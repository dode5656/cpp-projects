# Tic-Tac-Toe

I had an idea to play with classes in C++. I decided to make a game out of it and that game was Tic-Tac-Toe.

## How to play

You can play with someone else as X or O. Currently there is no computer to play with. (I will try to add it later hopefully)

There are 9 positions to play:

- Top left: `tl`
- Top middle: `tm`
- Top right: `tr`
- Middle left: `ml`
- Middle: `mm`
- Middle right: `mr`
- Bottom left: `bl`
- Bottom middle: `bm`
- Bottom right: `br`

If any player gets 3 Xs or Os in a row/column/diagonal they win the game. It is a draw if the game ends with no winner.
