# Pancake Glutton Challenge

  

This is my first C++ program! Its the Pancake Glutton challenge. I thought it would be good for me to start with coding solutions for challenges I find online. Rules are:

	Requires:

	 variables, data types, and numerical operators

	 basic input/output

	 logic (if statements, switch statements)

	 loops (for, while, do-while)

	 arrays

  

	Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of pancakes eaten for breakfast by 10
	different people (Person 1, Person 2, ..., Person 10). Once the data has been entered the
	program must analyze the data and output which person ate the most pancakes for breakfast.

  

	+ Modify the program so that it also outputs which person ate the least number of pancakes for breakfast.

	++++ Extra: Modify the program so that it outputs a list in order of number of pancakes eaten of all 10 people.

	i.e.

	Person 4: ate 10 pancakes

	Person 3: ate 7 pancakes

	Person 8: ate 4 pancakes
			  ...
	Person 5: ate 0 pancakes
	

 My code is not the best, but it does what the challenge requires. Test it as much as you want.
